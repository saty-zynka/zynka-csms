# Security Policy

The Zynka project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure the CSMS, from the business logic to its underlying infrastructure.
To that end, we continuously review security vulnerabilities, as well as security hotspots in the code, and provide fixes in a timely manner.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities in the Issues section of this github repository.
By keeping security issues visible, we leverage our community in helping fix them promptly. Consequently, a patched version of Zynka can be released to users.

Our team will then review your request, and work with the maintainers of the affected component(s) to get the issue resolved.
